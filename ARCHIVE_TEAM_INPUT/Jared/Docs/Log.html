                <h1><b>Line Connection Bug</b></h1> <br />
            Here is a series of polygons created with the annotation tool and connect lines function
            <br /><img src="log images/before line bug.PNG" alt=""/>
            <br /> But, if we click "delete all annotations," then 'cancel' when it tries to confirm "ARE YOU SURE?", all lines are deleted
            <br /> <b>Note: Image from different session.  This bug does not change point locations.</b> <br /><img src="log images/cancelresume2.PNG" alt=""/>
            <br /> Worse yet, if we click "delete last annotation point" after a mistake...
            <br /> <img src="log images/after line bug.PNG" alt=""/>
            <br /> <i> Perfect </i> fix not yet discovered.  All fixes found end up deleting ALL lines upon delete last point.  This is an improvement, but not quite what we want.

                <br /><img src="log images/linewidth.png" alt=""/>
                <br />Line segements are thinner to allow for precision work without the need to zoom browser.
                <br /><img src="log images/clickfunction.png" alt=""/>
                <br />Added jQuery .click(function() { . . . }); feature to connect points button for a highlight.  This tells the user whether the button is pressed or not.

            At this point, Edward and showed me the differences tool in netbeans, and I will use it to document my work.  The code below is a working code and not functional, just for demonstration purposes.
            <br /> Example:
            <br /> <img src="log images/diff.PNG" alt=""/>
            </div>

                <h1><b>Image Uploader Virus</b></h1><br />
                <br />Approached several methods of uploading a virus to the site, including fake images and infected files. Fake images were immediately rejected by the image uploader -- a result of the "get dimensions" function in the .php code that runs the uploader. <br/>
                Infected images were uploaded, but would <b>NOT</b> execute. The webapp even blocked annotation to prevent any vulnerabilities in the read/write processes it uses. See images below.
